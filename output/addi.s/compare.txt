Helpful resources for Debugging:
verilator.trace : output from the VHDL testbench during program execution on your processor
rars.trace : output from RARS containing expected output
wave.vcd: waveform file generated by processor simulation, you can display this simulation in gtkwave without resimulating your processor by hand
